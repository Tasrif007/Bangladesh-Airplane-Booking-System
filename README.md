# Bangladesh-Airplane-Booking-System
This is  my VIP lab project 

In this project, I implement an airline booking system . I assume that all of the fights are daily flights. A new user can create an account first, then search and add flights to his/her cart. There are two flight options provided for searching: one-way and round-trip, users can also filter the results according to whether or not there is an intermediate stop. An admin user can add, delete and update any flights. I make an assumption that all of the operations are cascading.

Languages:
PHP 5 - server side scripting.
Javascript/JQuery/Ajax - client side scripting.
Bootstrap/CSS - design the web pages.
